# Pandas-Challenge

While building my codes for the school and student data, I was able to assess which vairiables and strings to use. I started off with importing my data via the csv so that I read the files in my code. I was able to get my code established with help from "ChatGPT". I learned what each line in the code represented and why it was carried out in the manner in which it typed. While redoing the code with help I was able to get it run sucessfully this time, as this is my second time submitting this assignement. I aquired help from "ChatGPT" and "Xpert Learning" but both to no avail. From what I was able to see from the code itself is that we are trying to determine whether the percentage passing or failng in students for reading and math.
